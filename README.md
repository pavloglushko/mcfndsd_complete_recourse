Multi-commodity flow network design problems with demand uncertainty and complete recourse.



Based on the R instances from Rahmaniani et al. “A Benders Decomposition Method for Two-Stage Stochastic Network Design Problems.” CIRRELT 22 (2017): 2–3.

Complete recourse version is generated by adding slack variables to the right-hand side of the flow conservation
constraints.
